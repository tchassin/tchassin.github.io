# Personal projects

## Blade of Verdance

Blade of Verdance is a 2D story-driven turn-based RPG featuring pixel art. The game is mostly inspired by JRPGs such as Breath of Fire IV and Etrian Odyssey (for their gameplay) as well as Final Fantasy Tactics (for its world and story).

This is a project I have been developing with a friend since I was a student. It helped me learn Unity and gave me the opportunity to try writing and game design.

A playable demo is available on [itch.io](https://tchassin.itch.io/blade-of-verdance-demo).

## HexaBuilder

This is a small prototype I made in a couple weeks to learn how to make a simple simulation game and program a mouse-oriented UI.

The game is playable on [itch.io](https://tchassin.itch.io/hexabuilder) and the sources are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/tchassin/hexa-builder).
