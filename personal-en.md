# Blade of Verdance

Blade of Verdance is a 2D story-driven turn-based RPG featuring pixel art. The game is mostly inspired by classic JRPGs, for both their story and gameplay.

This is a project I have been developing with a friend since I was a student. It helped me learn Unity and gave me the opportunity to try writing and game design.

A playable demo is available on [itch.io](https://tchassin.itch.io/blade-of-verdance-demo).

# HexaBuilder

This is a small prototype I made in a couple weeks to learn how to make a simple simulation game and program a mouse-oriented UI.

I also used this opportunity to learn more about 3D modeling and texturing with Blender.

The game is playable on [itch.io](https://tchassin.itch.io/hexabuilder) and the sources are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/tchassin/hexa-builder).

# 7-Day Shmup

This is another prototype made is a week, working full-time. I tried making a small game in a genre I am not familiar with and work on something more action-oriented than my previous Unity project.

I also used this opportunity to learn some basic 3D modeling in Blender.
