# Personal projects

## Blade of Verdance

Blade of Verdance is a 2D story-driven turn-based RPG featuring pixel art. The game is mostly inspired by classic JRPGs, for both their story and gameplay.

This is a project I have been developing with a friend since I was a student. It helped me learn Unity and gave me the opportunity to try writing and game design.

A playable demo is available on [itch.io](https://tchassin.itch.io/blade-of-verdance-demo).
